                <p>The world demand for cell phones is going up sharply, fueled by advanced technological change and increasing consumer development. To supply this demand effectively, manufacturers depend extensively on industrial robots. These machines are now an essential part of the manufacturing process, executing tasks with velocity, accuracy, and consistency that human laborer cannot reproduce on a regular basis.</p>

                <p>
                    Industrial robots are programmable machines that can perform a variety of complex manufacturing functions automatically. Their use in mobile phone manufacturing has turned conventional assembly lines into highly automated systems.
